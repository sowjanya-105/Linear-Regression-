* Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.

### Tasks Performed:
* Import the required libraries
* Read in the Ecommerce Customers csv file as a DataFrame called customers
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
* Create a linear model plot (using seaborn's lmplot) 
* Split the data into training and testing sets
* Train the model on training data
* Evaluate its performance by predicting the test values
* Evaluate the Model
* Explore the residuals
* Conclusion
